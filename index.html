        <b><p>Alright By: Kendrick Lamar: <br>
            I chose this song because it talks about the resilience of Blacks.
            <br><br>
            I Can't Breathe By: H.E.R:<br>
            I chose this song because it shows how frustrated and heartbroken Blacks were while getting treated poorly.
            <br><br>
            Changes By: 2Pac: <br>
            I chose this song because it talks about the social issues that Black people had, wanting change and never giving up until they got equality.
            <br><br>
            "A Change is Gonna Come" by Sam Cooke:<br>
            I chose this song because it was an anthem for the civil rights movement, which gave Blacks hope while going through the struggle to fight for equality. 
            <br><br>
            Where is The Love? By Black Eyed Peas: <br>
            I chose this song because it questions why they went through racial struggles and instead of hating each other, we should make peace and love for each other.

        <b><p>In the past Black people were often treated terribly and had to endure cruelty, pain, and injustice, but their resilience led them to the Civil Rights Movement, this movement soon gaves rights to black throughout the U.S and even today most recent movements such as BLM are still helping blacks today be treated equally as everyone else. </p></b>
